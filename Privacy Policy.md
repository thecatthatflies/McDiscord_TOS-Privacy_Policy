### 1. Data Collected
MC-DC Utilities is designed for **private, personal use only**. The bot does **not collect, store, or share any personal data** outside of the functionality required to link the Minecraft server with the Discord server.  

Specifically, the bot may temporarily process:  
- Discord user IDs (for command execution and permissions).  
- Minecraft usernames or UUIDs (for server integration).  

No other data is collected, logged, or shared.  

---

### 2. Data Storage
- No long-term storage of personal data is performed.  
- Temporary data processed during bot operation is cleared once it is no longer needed.  

---

### 3. Data Sharing
- Data is **never shared with third parties**.  
- Data remains entirely within the personal Minecraft and Discord servers controlled by me, the owner.  

---

### 4. User Rights
Since the bot is private and restricted to my own servers, **no external users** have data rights or obligations. However, any users granted access to my Discord or Minecraft server can request clarification about the botâ€™s functions.
